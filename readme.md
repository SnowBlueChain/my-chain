## üë®‚Äçüíª Development (Linux, Mac)

The node can be built and installed wherever Java can run. To build and test this project, you will have to follow these
steps:

<details><summary><b>Show instructions</b></summary>

*1. Setup the environment.*

- Install Java for your platform:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre                     # Ubuntu
# or
# brew cask install adoptopenjdk/openjdk/adoptopenjdk8 # Mac
```

- Install SBT (Scala Build Tool)

Please follow the SBT installation instructions depending on your
platform ([Linux](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Linux.html)
, [Mac](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Mac.html)
, [Windows](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Windows.html))

*2. Clone this repo*

```bash
git clone https://github.com/erachain/Erachain
```

*3. Compile and run tests*

```bash
sbt checkPR
```

*4. Run integration tests (optional)*

- Run one test:

```bash
sbt node-it/testOnly *.TestClassName
# or 
# bash node-it/testOnly full.package.TestClassName
```

*5. Build packages*

```bash
sbt packageAll                   # Mainnet
```

`sbt packageAll` ‚Äåproduces only `deb` package along with a fat `jar`.

*6. Install DEB package*

`deb` package is located in target folder. You can replace '*' with actual package name:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i node/target/*.deb
```
